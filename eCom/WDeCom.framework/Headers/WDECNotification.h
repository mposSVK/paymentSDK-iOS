/**
 @brief Transaction notification
 @details ElasticEngine has a built-in notification capability. The Merchant simply sends the notifications instructions as part of each transaction request. Notifications need to be specified as a URL. There are two types of notifications:
 
 - HTTP(S) (Web Server POST)
 - SMTP (Email with URL scheme 'mailto')
 
 It is possible to setup conditional notifications based on the [state](WDECTransactionState) of transaction. For example, a Merchant can instruct a notification to only occur on WDECTransactionStateFailed or WDECTransactionStateSuccess transactions.
